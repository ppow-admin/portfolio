GIT STASH INSTALLATION NOTES

Notes culled together when I was installing and setting up an instance of Git Stash...




Download from : https://www.atlassian.com/software/stash/download

Do:
java -version
The version of Java should be 1.6.0 or higher.

git --version
The version of Git should be 1.7.6 or higher. 

==============================================
       ****updated to make both servers match*****
==============================================
[root@vgit01.atlc1 ~]# git --version
git version 1.8.4.1

[root@vgit02.atlc1 bin]# git --version
git version 1.8.4.1

https://code.google.com/p/git-core/downloads/list

tar -zxf git-1.8.4.1.tar.gz
cd git-1.8.4.1
yum install perl-ExtUtils-CBuilder perl-ExtUtils-MakeMaker
make prefix=/usr all
sudo make prefix=/usr install
==============================================

perl --version
The version of Perl should be 5.8.8 or higher.

Untar the Stash-x.x.x.tar file downloaded from Atlassian to /var/Stash-x.x.x.tar

Create the "stash_home" dir OUTSIDE of the installavtion dir  Ex. /var/stashhome

Edit the setenv.sh file inside /var/Stash-x.x.x/bin and point the STASH_HOME directive to /var/stashhome or whereever you decided to put stashhome in the previous step.

You should not locate your Stash home directory inside the  <Stash installation directory> — they should be entirely separate locations. If you do put the home directory in the  <Stash installation directory>  it will be overwritten, and lost, when Stash gets upgraded. And by the way, you'll need separate Stash home directories if you want to run multiple instances of Stash.

From here you can start Stash by running /var/Stash-x.x.x/bin/start-stash.sh

In your browser, go to http://vgit01.atlc1:7990 and run through the Setup Wizard.

==============================================
SETUP WIZARD
==============================================

If you use a external database such as Oracle you will need to do the following with the DBAs:

Request a database to be created...

The character set of the database must be set to either AL32UTF8 or UTF8, to support storage of Unicode data as per the Oracle documentation.
Note that it is important to the proper operation of Stash that the database store its data in a case-sensitive manner. By changing the values of the NLS_COMP and/or NLS_SORT variables, it is possible to cause Oracle to perform its searches in a case-insensitive manner. We therefore strongly recommend that those variables be left at their default values.
Create a user that Stash will connect as (e.g.  stash ). 
Remember the database user name; it will be used to configure Stash's connection to the database in subsequent steps.

It is strongly recommended that you create a new database user for use by Stash rather than sharing one that is used by other applications or people.
Grant the Stash user connect and resource roles only. The connect role is required to set up a connection, while resource role is required to allow the user to create objects in its own schema.
Create a local all_objects view to the user's schema, so that there is no possibility that a table with the same name as one of the Stash tables in another schema will cause any conflicts.

The format of the command to create a user in Oracle is:

CREATE USER <user> 
    IDENTIFIED BY <password>;
GRANT CONNECT, RESOURCE to <user>;
CREATE VIEW <user>.all_objects AS
  SELECT *
  FROM sys.all_objects
  WHERE owner = upper('<user>');



==============================================
SUBGIT
==============================================

Add to this file: /var/subgit-2.0.0/bin/subgit

EXTRA_JVM_ARGUMENTS="-Dsun.io.useCanonCaches=false -Djava.awt.headless=true -Xmx1024M" $EXTRA_JVM_ARGUMENTS \


==============================================
RESTORE PROCESS  (This will need to be automated much more with scripts)
==============================================
Tar up the installation folder on server1

Move the tar file to server 2 to /var

Explode the tar file


Run the backup client located on Server1 at /var/stash-backup-client-1.0.0/

DO: 
java -jar stash-backup-client.jar
cd /var/stashbkup/backups/
scp stash-xxxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxx.tar root@vgit02.atlc1:/var/stash-backup-client-1.0.0/stash-xxxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxx.tar



Make sure that /var/stashhome does NOT exist on Server2. The restore client will create it for you.

You will then need to go to: /var/stash-backup-client-1.0.0

DO: 
java -cp /var/stash-backup-client-1.0.0/jdbc/ojdbc6-11.2.0.2.0.jar -jar stash-restore-client.jar /var/stashbkup/stash-xxxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxx.tar


Once this completes you can startup Stash at /var/stash/bin/start-stash.sh
